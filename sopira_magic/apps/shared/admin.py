   Shared Admin - Django Admin Configuration.

   Django admin interface configuration for shared models.
   Currently placeholder - shared models are abstract base classes
   and don't require direct admin registration.

   Note:
   - SharedBaseModel and SharedNamedModel are abstract models
   - Admin classes are defined in core/admin.py for base models
   - This file is placeholder for future shared admin functionality

from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.
